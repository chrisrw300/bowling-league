## Description:
This website is for a mock bowling league in need of a simple, yet gripping website.

Here is the client's story:

I want a website for my bowling league to educate and recruit potential new members.
When I get to the homepage, 
I want to see our league name ("Team Alpha") and navigation, a hero image of our team, and our slogan.
When I go to the Our Story page,
I want to see images and stories of our past and current histories of victories
When I go to the Our Team page,
I want to see images, names, descriptions, and awards won by each member.
When I go to our contact page,
I want to have our contact info, a form to send us a quick email, and our location
At the bottom of each page,
I want a footer that has the copyright logo and current year, our phone number, our address, and the web devlopers name that links to their website.
